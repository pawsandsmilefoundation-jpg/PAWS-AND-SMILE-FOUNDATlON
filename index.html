      <h1>Paws and Smile Foundation</h1>
      <p>We believe every paw deserves a smile. Join us in making the lives of stray dogs better—by feeding, sheltering, and loving them. Our work spans across city streets and slums where countless street dogs and underprivileged children share not just their pain, but their friendship. We are committed to not only helping animals in need but also spreading compassion, awareness, and community welfare. Whether it’s through medical support, daily feeding, or rehoming efforts—we’re driven by kindness and empathy.</p>
